# Data-Wrangling-Project---Netflix-Movies-Dataset
📊 Data Wrangling Project — Netflix Movies Dataset
Transforming Raw Streaming Data into Actionable Insights

This project focuses on cleaning, wrangling, and preparing a Netflix movies dataset for analysis using Python and essential data handling libraries. The goal was to ensure data quality, accuracy, and usability for future exploratory data analysis (EDA) or machine learning tasks.

🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I performed several key data wrangling steps such as:

Importing, assessing, and cleaning raw movie data

Handling missing & inconsistent values

Fixing incorrect datatypes (e.g., dates & numeric fields)

Removing duplicates and standardizing formatting

Exporting the cleaned dataset for further use

The outcome is a polished dataset ready for deeper insights into Netflix’s movie catalog.
